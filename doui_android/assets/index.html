<h1>Tasks is a ToDo App</h1>

<p>Inspired by David Allen's great book, "Getting Things Done", you can manage your tasks by Status, Category, or Context.</p>

<p>Tasks provides 5 lists to manage tasks based on WHEN they should get done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Next: tasks that you should work on as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Waiting: tasks you are waiting for someone to work on.</li>

<li>Calendar: tasks that are scheduled.</li>

<li>Done: tasks you got done!</li>

<li>Someday: tasks you want to get to, but are not sure when.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Creating New Tasks</h1>

<p>Create a new task by adding a new item to one of the Status lists (Next, Waiting, Calendar, Someday), add a Title, pick a Category, and Save.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can type a "@&lt;person/place/thing&gt;" as part of the Title or Description to automatically add this item to a Context list. Contexts are usually people, places, or even things, necessary to complete the task.</p>

<p>For instance, if we add a new item to the Next list, like this:</p>

<p><b>Title:</b> Pick up flowers<br/>

<b>Description:</b> Remember @molly prefers red roses<br/>

<b>Category:</b> Family<br/></p>

<p>The task will appear in 3 lists: Next, Family, and a list called "@molly".</p>

<p>New tasks can be added either to Status lists or to Categories.</p>
